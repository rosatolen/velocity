The goal of this app is to make it even more enjoyable to work on being the person I want to be through a reward and tracking system that is easy to maintain.

Omnifocus doesn't cut it because it does not tie things to rewards. But omnifocus is easily reachable from all devices.
HabitRPG doesn't cut it because it's not flexible in the way you can portray the picture of your future self. But it's got an edge of fun to it.
Trello doesn't cut it because it is also not flexible around the way you can portray the picture of your future self. But it is easy to use and customize.
Mingle is difficult to use and does not allow flexibility around how to envision the goals and whys of the tasks and rituals I've focused on. But it allows me to track myself over time. 

The why of your goals will be what is highlighted the most in this application because that's ultimately what drives people to do things that they want to do even though they don't know how to discipline themselves.
